## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework

- Next.js for React framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components

### State Management

1. Context Providers Hierarchy:

   ```
   CartProvider
   └── GlobalModalProvider
       └── ReservationProvider
           └── ThemeProvider
               └── LanguageProvider
                   └── TranslationProvider
   ```

2. Key Contexts:
   - CartContext: Shopping cart state and operations
   - ReservationContext: Table booking and management
   - GlobalModalContext: Modal display management
   - LanguageContext: Language selection
   - TranslationContext: Translation strings

### Data Persistence

- localStorage for cart items
- localStorage for table reservations
- Theme preferences
- Language preferences

### Component Structure

- /components
  - /cart: Cart-related components
  - /menu: Menu display components
  - /reservation: Table booking components
  - /ui: Reusable UI components

### Testing

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Test coverage for critical features

## Performance Optimizations

- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Next.js Image Optimization
- Tree-shakeable ESM imports
- Responsive image loading
- Code splitting
- Component lazy loading

## Security Considerations

- Form validation
- Data sanitization
- Error boundary implementation
- Secure state management
- Input validation

## Accessibility Features

- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Semantic HTML structure

## Development Standards

1. Code Organization:

   - Feature-based component structure
   - Consistent file naming conventions
   - Clear component hierarchy
   - Shared UI components library

2. Styling Guidelines:

   - Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Custom theme configuration
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Dark/light theme variables

3. State Management Patterns:
   - Context + Reducer pattern
   - Local storage persistence
   - Type-safe actions and state
   - Centralized state management

## Deployment & Build

- Vercel Analytics integration
- Speed Insights tracking
- ESLint configuration
- TypeScript strict mode
- Next.js optimization features

2. Order History
3. Customer Accounts
4. Staff Dashboard
5. Kitchen Display System
6. Loyalty Program
7. Mobile App Version
8. Advanced Analytics

## Development Workflow

1. Version Control: Git
2. Code Reviews
3. Testing Requirements
4. Documentation Standards
5. Performance Monitoring
6. Accessibility Testing
