# Sprint 2: Menu System

## Sprint Overview

- **Duration**: 2 weeks (Weeks 3-4)
- **Main Goals**: Implement menu display, category filtering, search capabilities
- **Story Points**: 29

## Session Prompts

### 1. Menu Display Components

```prompt
Need to implement the menu display components for Brew & Bean.
Requirements:
- Menu item card component with:
  - Image display
  - Name and price
  - Description
  - Badge system (Popular, Classic, etc.)
  - Temperature indicators (hot/iced)
  - Customization options
- Menu grid layout with responsive design
- Loading skeleton states
- Nutritional information display
Technical Considerations:
- Use Next.js Image optimization
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Use shadcn/ui components
- Handle loading states
Resume from this point to build the menu display system.
```

### 2. Search and Filter System

```prompt
Let's create the search and filter functionality for the menu.
Requirements:
- Search implementation with:
  - Real-time search updates
  - Clearing selected category on search
  - Search by name and description
- Category filtering with:
  - All items
  - Coffee
  - Tea
  - Food categories
- State management for:
  - Selected category
  - Search term
  - Filter combinations
Technical Considerations:
- Use useState for state management
- Implement useEffect for search/filter interactions
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Handle edge cases (no results, loading states)
Resume here to implement the search and filter system.
```

### 3. Menu Item Features

```prompt
Implement the menu item features and customization options.
Requirements:
- Customization options including:
  - Milk options (Whole, Skim, Soy, Oat)
  - Coffee type options
  - Sugar level options
  - Temperature preferences
- Nutritional information with:
  - Calories
  - Protein
  - Fat
  - Carbs
- Badge system with:
  - Dynamic badge colors
  - Badge categories (Popular, Classic, etc.)
- Image handling:
  - Optimized images
  - Loading states
  - Fallback images
Technical Considerations:
- Implement type-safe customization options
- Use proper state management for options
- Handle edge cases for nutrition data
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
Resume from this point to add menu item features.
```

### 4. Category Navigation

```prompt
Create the category navigation system for the menu.
Requirements:
- Category tabs/pills
- Category filtering
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-responsive design
Resume here to build the category navigation.
```

### 5. Menu State Management

```prompt
Implement the menu state management system.
Requirements:
- Menu data structure:
  - Item ID and category
  - Name, price, description
  - Image paths
  - Badge information
  - Temperature options
  - Customization settings
  - Nutritional data
- State management for:
  - Selected category
  - Search term
  - Loading states
  - Filter combinations
- Side effects handling:
  - Category and search interactions
  - Loading timeouts
  - Data fetching simulation
Technical Considerations:
- Use TypeScript interfaces for menu items
- Implement useState and useEffect hooks
- Handle state persistence if needed
- Manage loading states effectively
Resume from this point to implement state management.
```
