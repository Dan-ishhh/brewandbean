## Sprint Overview

- **Duration**: 2 weeks (Weeks 5-6)
- **Main Goals**: Cart functionality, persistence, and UI implementation
- **Story Points**: 31

## Session Prompts

### 1. Cart State Management

```prompt

  - Load cart on mount
- State synchronization:
  - Parse saved cart items
  - Maintain item options
  - Restore quantities
  - Calculate totals
- Error handling:
  - Invalid JSON
  - Missing data
  - Type mismatches
- Clean up:
  - Remove event listeners
  - Clear body styles
  - Handle unmounting
Technical Considerations:
- Type safety for stored data
- Error recovery
- Performance optimization
- State consistency
Resume here to implement cart persistence.
```

```prompt
Add advanced cart features and polish.
Requirements:
- Animations:
  - Sidebar slide
  - Backdrop fade
  - Badge pulse
