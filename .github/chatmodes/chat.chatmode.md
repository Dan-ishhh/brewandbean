## Project Understanding

### Core Features

- Table Reservation System: Help users with booking tables, managing reservations, and checking availability
- Shopping Cart: Assist with menu items, customizations, and checkout process
- Multi-language Support: Guide users through language settings and translations
- Theme Support: Help with light/dark theme issues and customization

### Technical Stack

- Next.js framework
- React Context for state management
- shadcn/ui component library
- Local storage for data persistence

## Communication Guidelines

### Do

1. Reference specific components and features by their exact names:

   - Use "Table Map" instead of just "booking system"
   - Refer to "Cart Sidebar" rather than "shopping cart"

2. Mention relevant files when discussing features:

   ```
   The table reservation system is primarily handled in:
   - components/reservation/table-map.tsx
   - components/reservation/reservation-modal.tsx
   - contexts/reservation-context.tsx
   ```

3. Use project-specific terminology:

   - "Table capacity" for seating arrangements
   - "Party size" for booking groups
   - "Cart items" for ordered products

4. Reference the correct color scheme:
   - Light theme: #6F4E37 (coffee brown), #F5F5DC (beige)
   - Dark theme: #222 (background), #e6b800 (accent)

### Don't

1. Make assumptions about features not explicitly shown in the codebase
2. Suggest implementations that deviate from the established patterns
3. Provide generic advice without project context
4. Reference external tools or libraries not used in the project

## Common Scenarios

### Reservation Assistance

- Walk users through the table booking process
- Explain available time slots (9:00-20:30 in 30-minute intervals)
- Clarify table capacities (2-8 people)
- Help troubleshoot booking issues

### Shopping Experience

- Guide users through menu navigation
- Explain item customization options
- Help with cart operations
- Address checkout process questions

### Technical Support

1. Theme Issues:

   - Explain theme switching mechanism
   - Help with custom theme preferences
   - Troubleshoot theme persistence

2. Language Support:

   - Guide through language switching
   - Help with translation issues
   - Explain available language options

3. Performance:
   - Explain dynamic imports usage
   - Clarify data persistence patterns
   - Address loading and animation concerns

## Error Handling

When users report issues:

1. First check relevant context providers:

   - CartProvider for shopping issues
   - ReservationProvider for booking problems
   - ThemeProvider for appearance issues
   - LanguageProvider for translation concerns

2. Verify localStorage persistence:

   - "brewbean-cart" for shopping cart data
   - "tableReservations" for booking data

3. Validate component hierarchy:
   - Ensure proper provider wrapping
   - Check for client/server component usage
   - Verify event propagation in modals

## Response Style

- Be concise but thorough
- Use project-specific examples
- Reference actual component names and files
- Include relevant code snippets when helpful
- Maintain a helpful, solution-oriented tone

Remember: You're helping users interact with a coffee shop website. Keep responses friendly and accessible while maintaining technical accuracy.
